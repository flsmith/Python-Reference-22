    "# While loops\n",
    "`For` loops are a very valuable construct for repeating something when you already know how many times you will need to repeat (even if that is determined by some other variable). However, we often wish to repeat until a condition is no longer satisfied. For example, we might summarise the process of debugging as \"while there are still bugs in the program, fix a bug!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers the `while` loop for this purpose. It has the following form:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while <condition>:\n",
    "    things to do while the condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python will first evaluate the condition. If it is `True`, then the loop body will be run. The condition will then be checked again, and if it is `True` the loop body will be run again. This continues until the condition evaluates to `False`.\n",

    "# Infinite loops\n",
    "There is a danger lurking in `while` loops: what happens if the condition *never* becomes `False`? Python will simply keep running the loop body forever. This is called an ***infinite loop***, and is one of the common causes of programs freezing or crashing. Whenever you write a `while` loop, you should consider how you know it will eventually finish, i.e. how you know that the condition will eventually be false. It is [literally impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) for Python to decide whether a general `while` loop will terminate, and so it is up to you as the programmer!\n",
    "Proving that a `while` loop will terminate often requires some mathematical insight.\n",
    "\n",
    " If you run into an infinite loop (or simply a loop which is taking too long to terminate), you can stop Python executing your code by clicking the \"stop\" button in the menu beside the \"Run\" button."

    "# `Break`ing out of loops\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common alternatives used to break out of while loops. The first is the `break` statement. When this is encountered in a loop, Python will immediately stop executing the loop and go to the next line in the code. If you have nested loops, `break` will only break out of the inner-most loop that contains the `break` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, a `break` statement is used to exit a `while` loop when the user inputs the correct number. We'll discuss user input more in the final worksheet. If you execute the following cell, Python will get \"stuck\" in the loop and you will have to exit using the \"stop\" button in the menu bar, or by guessing the correct number. The technique used in this example - using `while True` to keep looping and processing user input - is called an \"event loop\" and lies at the heart of any program you can interact with continuously, like office software or games."
