    "Throughout the previous Notebooks, we have been using ***functions*** provided by Python or by modules like `numpy` or `mobilechelonian`. Functions are one of the key features of programming languages that allow us to write complex programs. When we talk about functions in programming, we mean something more general than in mathematics.\n",
    "A function is simply a piece of code that achieves a particular task, and is written in such a way that it can be ***called*** whenever that task needs to be done. One of the key skills in programming is splitting up a problem into smaller sub-problems (i.e. smaller problems) that can be solved by functions.\n",
